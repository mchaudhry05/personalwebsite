			<p>Hi there! My name is Mafaz Chaudhry. I'm currently a rising Junior at Vassar College majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Math. I'm proficient in Python and Java. I love combining my various passions with programming. Recently, I made a quiz app based off of my favorite rapper Drake. Currently, I'm working on combining my love for superhero movies and programming, by developing a program that writes a superhero movie script using machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>

			<p>My most recent project includes using reactJS to create a game. The game esentially combines my passion for programming and music. It features three levels: a level where you answer which song appears on the album shown, the second level features lyrics and you must answer the song to which those lyrics belong to, and the third level is where a snippet of a song plays and you must choose the name of the song. The game uses Firebase as a backend to store user scores. This project is still a work in progress. <a class="links" href="https://the-biggest-fan.web.app/">Click here to Play!</a>

				<br>Another project I want to mention is a 3D printed medicine dispenser. In my Software Design and Implementation class, we were tasked to go to a retirement home and ask the Seniors for their input for a medicine dispenser. We then spent the next couple of weeks creating low-fidelty prototypes. My team wanted to create a medicine dispenser that was going to be housed in one place and one that was more portable. Hence, we created two medicine dispensers, the bigger one would be the one from which our client would be able to refill their portable dispenser. First, we designed our medicine dispensers so they could be 3D printed. Next, we wanted to have an alarm go off when it was time to refill the portable dispenser and an alarm that would tell the user when to take their medication. I worked with one other member of our team to implement the alarm feature, we added a Real-Time Clock module to our Arduino. We designed the medicine dispenser like a gum-ball machine so once the alarms went off on the big dispenser we would have LED lights turn on indicating which knobs the user should turn to dispense the medication. My last task was to turn off these lights after the pill had been dispensed. I implemented an algorithm utlizing the IR Sensors that would detect a pill drop and turn off the lights. We performed numerous user tests throughout the project following the agile development model.

				<br>The next project I want to mention is a Polynomial Calculator I built using Java. In my Data Structures and Algorithms class, we were tasked to make a Polynomial Calculator. I first created various tokens: operator, parentheses, and operands. I also assigned the operators sigficance levels which followed the rules of PEMDAS. My next step was to create an algorithm that scanned each element at a time and catorgrized it to one of my token groups. Next, I wrote code to check to see if the input was in the correct format. Here, I had to make sure that my program didn't crash when an error occurred so I implemented many error handling situations. I then converted my input from infix notation to postfix notation, from there I preformed the said operations to return the correct result to the user.</p>
